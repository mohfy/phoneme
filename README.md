  Spelling doesn't always reflect pronunciationâ€”especially across different dialects or languages.
  If you're learning English or teaching phonetics, you need a tool that shows how words are really spoken.
</p>

<p align="center">
  <strong>Phoneme</strong> converts English (and other languages) words into the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA),
  providing a clear and standardized representation of pronunciation.
